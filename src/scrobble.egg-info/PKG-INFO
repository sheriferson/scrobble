# Scrobble

A little very unofficial Python CLI tool to scrobble music to Last.fm.

> **Note**
> Super early, under active development, and so forth.


## Background

It started as a tool to scrobble CD tracklists using barcodes, and that's what it does today, but there are plans for it to do more.

Inspired by [CodeScrobble][] and [Open Scrobbler][].

[CodeScrobble]: https://codescrobble.com "CodeScrobble tool for scanning CD or record barcodes and scrobbling the tracklist."
[Open Scrobbler]: https://openscrobbler.com "Open Scrobbler tool for scrobbling albums or custom tracks."

## Features

- Scrobble a CD's tracklist using its barcode.
- Supports multi disc releases.
- Uses MusicBrainz as the source of CD and track metadata.
- Accepts an optional `PLAYBACKEND` argument in natural language if you want to scrobble a CD you listened to a while ago. e.g., `scrobble 016861828257 '2 hours ago'`.
- A `--dryrun` option if you just want to see a tracklist without sending anything to your last.fm account.
- A `--notify` option if you want to get a Pushover.net notification. Requires a Pushover app API token and a user key.
- If the barcode matches more than one release, the tool will ask you to choose. This matters because sometimes the tracklist is different (how releases that different end up with the same barcode is... pfff I don't know). If you want to yolo it, you can pass `--no-choice` and have the tool pick the first match.

## Installation

`pip install` coming soon.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sheriferson/scrobble
cd scrobble
pip3 install .
```

## Configuration

Okay you need to do some configuration before this will do anything useful for you. Some configurations are required (last.fm) and others are optional (Pushover).

You need to [get a last.fm API account][lastfmapi]. It's easy and immediate. Once you have a key and a secret, put them in `~/.config/cdscrobble.toml`:

[lastfmapi]: https://www.last.fm/api/account/create "Create a last.fm API account."

**Below is the mininum required configuration for this tool to work.**
```toml
[lastfmapi]
api_key = '<your-api-key>'
api_secret = '<your-api-secret>'
username = '<optional-username-for-url-in-pushover-notification>'
```

The first time you try to scrobble something, the app will ask you to give it permission to connect to your last.fm account, so you will need access to the machine's screen/browser. Once this is done, it will save a session key in `~/.lastfm_session_key`, and shouldn't need to ask for permission again.

If you want this tool to run on a remote/headless server, you can run the tool once on your local machine, then copy `~/.config/.lastfm_session_key` over your remote host.

If you plan on using `--notify` to get notifications when scrobbling is complete, you need to provide a Pushover API token and user key as well:


```toml
[pushoverapi]
token = '<your-pushover-app-token>'
user = '<your-user-key>'
```

## Usage

```sh
scrobble --help
